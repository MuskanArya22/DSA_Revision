# Time Complexity-> Rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.
#!ALT+z to format according to window size of VS Code

# Big-Oh Notation-> O()

//for example
for(i=0;i<=s;i++)//i=1  --Step 1
                 //i<=s --Step 2
                 //cout<<"Raj";  --Step 3
                 //i++  --Step 4
                 //            :[repeating 1,2,3,4 n times]
                 //            :
                 //            :
                 //            n
{
    cout<<"Raj";
}
#THREE MUST USE RULES--
->always compute your Time complexity in worst case scenario
->avoid Constants
->avoid lower values






take example

BEST CASE->          AVERAGE CASE->            WORST CASE->
when program         when program              when program
